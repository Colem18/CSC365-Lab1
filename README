Compiling Instructions:
    Run command "javac *.java" in order to compile
    Run command "./runTests" which runs the schoolSearch program
        with input redirection with tests.txt and outputs it to a
        tests.out file. This script also finds the differences
        between tests.out and expected.out and will print any
        differences it finds to the terminal.
